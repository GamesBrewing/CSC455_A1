Assignment 1

Instructions:

Part 2 (12 points):
Using Visual Studio Community Edition (or higher, if you already have it), create the following program (details below) in a C# project of type “Console Application (.NET Framework)”. You may need to install “.NET Desktop Development” from the “Tools”→”Get Tools and Features” menu path. Work with the Visual Studio “Git Changes” window (typically in the top right by Solution Explorer) and commit your work as you go, for example, one revision for the initial project creation, and one for each feature added. Make sure to add a description for each revision. For anyone who may not have taken CSC 260, here’s some C# help.

The program should have the following features:
1 - A menu of features to house everything after #1.
2 - Option 1) Choose a random positive integer from 1 to 10 and output it to the console.
3 - Option 2) Provide today's date in Short Date String format and output it to the console.
4 - Option 3) Create a LIST of 10 dinosaur names, order the list by the name (use LINQ), then output a random dinosaur name with the chosen list element based upon a random number.
5 - Option 4) Using the contents of the String class, input a string, then perform a random action on that string, using any property or method inside of the String class or LINQ methods. You will choose which one to perform based on a random number; minimum 10 options.
Examples: Reverse, Length, Substring, etc.

Rubric: 6 points, completion and correctness of C# project | 6 points, frequent commits with clear descriptions. Deliverables: C# code and project files as a .zip file, screenshot of working output, and screenshot of repository commit history for this part.
